Elements to test:
1. Add to Cart Button (Board Book)
2. Amazon Retailer Link (Board Book)
3. Barnes & Noble Retailer Link (Board Book)

Based on the provided DOM structure and the working selectors from Playwright, here are the precise CSS selectors for the elements within the Board Book format section:

## Element: Add to Cart Button (Board Book)
**Selector:** `#collapse2 button:has-text("Add to Cart")`

## Element: Amazon Retailer Link (Board Book)
**Selector:** `#collapse2 a:has-text("Amazon")`

## Element: Barnes & Noble Retailer Link (Board Book)
**Selector:** `#collapse2 a:has-text("Barnes & Noble")`

These selectors are specific to the Board Book section identified by `#collapse2` and are proven to work as per the Playwright results.
